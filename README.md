# ‚úÖ Customer Satisfaction Prediction

## üìå Project Overview

A machine learning classification project that predicts whether an airline customer is satisfied based on demographics (e.g., `Gender`, `Age`), travel details (e.g., `Class`, `Flight Distance`), and service feedback (e.g., `Inflight Wifi`, `Cleanliness`). Includes model tracking with MLflow and deployment via Streamlit.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Data Preprocessing
- Displa the basic information about the dataset
- Remove unnecessary column, Handled missing values and duplicates.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier handling using the capping method (**np.where**)
- Feature Engineering:
  - `Total Delay` = `Departure Delay + Arrival Delay`
  - `Service Quality Index` = Mean of selected service columns
  -('Inflight wifi service', 'Ease of Online booking', 'Food and drink',        'Online   boarding','Seat comfort', 'Inflight entertainment', 'On-board service', 'Leg room service','Baggage handling', 'Checkin service', 'Inflight service', 'Cleanliness')
  - `Frequent Flyer` = combined Customer Type	& Type of Travel	to Create Frequent Flyer feature
  - `On-Time Flight` = When the total delay is == 0
# Feature Scaling

##  **Which Features Need Scaling?**
| **Feature**                   | **Type**             | **Scaling Method** | **Why?** |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------|
| **Age**                        | Continuous (Numeric) | StandardScaler              | Typically normally distributed, requires centering. |
| **Flight Distance**            | Continuous (Numeric) | StandardScaler              | Varies widely, normalization helps models learn effectively. |
| **Total Delay**                | Continuous (Numeric) | StandardScaler              | Delays can be both positive and negative, needs centering. |
| **Service Quality Index**      | Score (0-5 range)   | MinMaxScaler                | Values already in a fixed range (0-5), keeping them between 0-1 ensures consistency. |
| **Inflight Wifi Service**       | Ordinal (0-5 scale) | MinMaxScaler                | Scores should be normalized for fair comparison. |
| **Departure/Arrival Convenience** | Ordinal (0-5 scale) | MinMaxScaler                | Scores should be normalized to balance their impact. |
| **Ease of Online Booking**      | Ordinal (0-5 scale) | MinMaxScaler                | Scores should be normalized for consistent weight. |
| **Food and Drink**              | Ordinal (0-5 scale) | MinMaxScaler                | Scores should be normalized for fair comparison. |
| **Seat Comfort**                | Ordinal (0-5 scale) | MinMaxScaler                | Scores should be normalized. |
| **Leg Room Service**            | Ordinal (0-5 scale) | MinMaxScaler                | Scores should be normalized. |
| **Baggage Handling**            | Ordinal (0-5 scale) | MinMaxScaler                | Scores should be normalized. |
| **Check-in Service**            | Ordinal (0-5 scale) | MinMaxScaler                | Scores should be normalized. |
| **Inflight Service**            | Ordinal (0-5 scale) | MinMaxScaler                | Scores should be normalized. |
| **Cleanliness**                 | Ordinal (0-5 scale) | MinMaxScaler                | Scores should be normalized. |
